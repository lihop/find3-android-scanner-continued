TODO add settings screen to configure various variables and settings (such as "scan interval")
  may also be worthwhile to add some sort of "power usage estimate" to settings, so users understand
  the impact to battery life their setting-adjustments can have.
TODO settings - add "power usage estimate" to various settings
  ideally this would give users some idea of what impact their current settings may have to battery life
TODO settings - add "minimum battery life" setting
  this setting would allow a user to set a minimum battery percentage required for background scanning,
  and would set the battery percentage at which scanning will automatically stop.
TODO report server connection status to user/if connection to server is lost/if connection quality to server degrades
